              the traditional clothing, art, music, and lifestyle of the Kyrgyz
              people, who are a Turkic ethnic group primarily residing in
              Kyrgyzstan, a landlocked country in Central Asia. Kyrgyz culture
              is rich and diverse, with a unique blend of nomadic traditions and
              influences from neighboring regions. One of the most distinctive
              aspects of Kyrgyz style is their traditional clothing. The
              traditional attire reflects the nomadic heritage of the Kyrgyz
              people and is often adorned with intricate patterns and vibrant
              colors. The main garment for men is the "chapan," a long robe-like
              coat made of wool or felt. It features wide sleeves and is usually
              embellished with decorative embroidery. The chapan serves as both
              a practical garment to protect against the harsh mountain climate
              and a symbol of cultural identity.

              For women, the traditional Kyrgyz clothing includes a dress called
              a "beldemchi" or "chyptama." It is a long, loose-fitting dress
              with a high waistline and wide sleeves. The dress is often made
              from silk or cotton and is adorned with colorful patterns and
              embroidery. Women also wear a headdress called a "elechek" or
              "kalpak," which is a tall, cone-shaped hat decorated with beads,
              feathers, and other ornaments. In addition to clothing, Kyrgyz
              style is also evident in their art and craftsmanship. Kyrgyz
              artisans are known for their skill in creating intricate and
              colorful tapestries, known as "shyrdaks." These felt rugs are made
              by hand using traditional techniques and feature geometric
              patterns and symbols inspired by nature and Kyrgyz folklore.

              refers to the traditional clothing, customs, and aesthetics of the
              Kazakh people, who are a Turkic ethnic group predominantly
              residing in Kazakhstan, as well as in neighboring countries such
              as China, Mongolia, and Russia. The Kazakh culture has deep roots
              in nomadic traditions and is characterized by a distinctive style
              of clothing that reflects their heritage. One of the most iconic
              elements of Kazakh traditional clothing is the "chapan" or
              "shapan." It is a long robe-like coat made of wool or fur and is
              commonly worn by both men and women. The chapan features a high
              collar, wide sleeves, and is often adorned with intricate
              embroidery and patterns. The coat serves as protection against the
              harsh climate of the Central Asian steppes and also serves as a
              symbol of cultural identity.

              Kazakh women traditionally wear a dress called a "saukele" for
              special occasions and weddings. The saukele is a headdress made of
              felt or velvet, embellished with gold or silver embroidery, beads,
              and precious stones. It is often paired with a long, flowing dress
              known as a "koye" or "koynek," which is typically made of silk or
              brocade fabric and features vibrant colors and ornate patterns.
              Another notable aspect of Kazakh traditional clothing is the
              "telpek," a traditional hat made of sheepskin or fox fur. The
              telpek is a cylindrical hat with a flat crown and is worn by both
              men and women, especially during winter to provide warmth. The hat
              is often decorated with fur tassels and embroidery, showcasing the
              craftsmanship and artistic skills of the Kazakh people.

              <span class="first-character atw">Turkish style</span>
              encompasses a wide range of influences, from traditional Ottoman
              attire to contemporary fashion trends. Turkey, located at the
              crossroads of Europe and Asia, has a rich cultural heritage that
              is reflected in its clothing and fashion. Traditional Turkish
              clothing is heavily influenced by the historical Ottoman Empire.
              One iconic garment is the "kaftan," a long, flowing robe-like
              dress worn by both men and women. Kaftans were made from luxurious
              fabrics such as silk and velvet and often featured elaborate
              embroidery and decorative patterns. They were worn on special
              occasions and by the ruling class. Over time, the kaftan has
              evolved into modern variations and is still appreciated for its
              elegant and regal aesthetic.

            <p class="margin-top-10">
              For men, traditional Turkish clothing includes the "şalvar" (baggy
              trousers) and "cepken" (a long jacket or vest). These garments
              were popular during the Ottoman era and are still worn on
              ceremonial occasions, particularly in rural areas. The "fes" is
              another traditional Turkish accessory—a cylindrical red hat made
              of felt, often associated with Ottoman officials and scholars. In
              rural regions of Turkey, traditional clothing varies among
              different ethnic groups and communities. For example, in the
              southeastern Anatolian region, Kurdish and Arab influences are
              evident in the clothing style. Traditional Kurdish attire includes
              the "şalvar" (baggy trousers) and the "çuval" (a large, loose
              shirt), often complemented by colorful waistbands and scarves.
